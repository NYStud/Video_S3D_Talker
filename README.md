# Video_S3D_Talker

Building and Updating...

Features of the project will be:

```
1. A transformer based video captioning architecture on YouCook2, MSR-VTT and V2C dataset.
```
```
2. 3D video features extracted from a largely pre-trained S3D models from HowTo100M dataset.
```
```
3. Performance reproduced from the recent video representation learning work:
    [Sun, Chen, et al. "Contrastive bidirectional transformer for temporal representation learning."](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05743.pdf)
```
```
4. Comparisons with other video captioning features like ResNet, or NCE finetuned S3D baselines.
```

Thanks Luowei Zhou for sharing his raw videos of [YouCook2 dataset](http://youcook2.eecs.umich.edu/).

and Antoine Miech, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac for their [HowTo100M pre-trained S3D models](https://github.com/antoine77340/S3D_HowTo100M).
