# Video_S3D_Talker

Building and Updating...

Features of the project will be:

1. A transformer based video captioning architecture on YouCook2, MSR-VTT and V2C dataset.
2. 3D video features extracted from a largely pre-trained S3D models from HowTo100M dataset.
3. Performance reproduced from the recent video captioning papers like:
    "Sun, Chen, et al. "Contrastive bidirectional transformer for temporal representation learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05743 (2019)."
4. Comparisons with other video captioning features like ResNet, or NCE finetuned S3D baselines.
